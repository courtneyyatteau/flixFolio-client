# Overview Information

This movie app is a project that combines the movie database I created with a user-interface. The app opens to a login page where the user can login or create an account. Once the user logs in their data is saved locally to prevent the user from having to login on their same device every time. 

Once inside the app, the user sees a list of featured movies, a search bar, and a navigation bar with profile and genre dropdown buttons. The user can see information about movies, genres, and directors by clicking through pictures and links. Two different search bars are utilized in this app. One is a direct search and load vs the other is a filter that filters out movies on the screen in real time. The user can add and remove movies to a favorites list, change their user profile information, or delete their account.
